Donor VIN - 3VWML7AJ8BM631357

### Turbo
- Stock = cr140 = bv43 = k03 = 5303 in BorgWarner designation - [source](https://forums.tdiclub.com/index.php?threads/turbo-technical-database.300010/page-13)
	- Can be clocked?
	- Stage 2
- GTB1756VK with electronic vacuum actuation, the Malone peeps say this is good for high altitude. [Xman Turbos](https://www.xmanturbos.com/product-page/gtb1756vk-top-mounted-turbo-longitudinal-16v-2-0tdi-cjaa-truck-swap) seems to be the best option
	- Inlet and outlet of the turbo cold side are both 55mm - you need appropriate pipework for that
	- Custom downpipe has to be fabricated, [we do supply flanges](https://www.xmanturbos.com/product-page/gtb-gtb2260vk-gtb1756vk-universal-downpipe-flange) if you are fabricating the downpipe yourself (search for GTBdownpipeflange in the shop)
	- Braided oil feed is required - [it can be found in our shop](https://www.xmanturbos.com/product-page/braided-oil-feed-mk4-mk5-mk6-dual-banjo-gtb-brm-bmm-bls-bmn)
	- ~~4 bar MAP sensor required - [found here](https://www.xmanturbos.com/product-page/bosch-4bar-map-sensor-small-probe-12mm-for-mk4-mk5-mk6-vw-tdis)~~ incorrect per Kerma
	- Custom oil return is required - it can be selected as an option with the turbo.
	- New GTB gaskets kit recommended - [available from us](https://www.xmanturbos.com/product-page/gtb17-22-downpipe-gasket-elongated-one)
- Intercooler, front mount. Factory radiator core is 20.75W x 18.75H
	- Move radiator back and mount intercooler in front?
	- 18x13x3?

I need the turbo mounted reverse compared to a standard CJAA application, so the compressor housing should be pointed towards the front of the engine for a truck application and the exhaust outlet from the turbine should point towards the back. It should look like the last 2 pictures in the product listing where it has been installed in a Tacoma. Also if possible, I do not need the EGR ports, but I would like to retain any factory EGT probe locations on the manifold if possible. I haven't removed my engine from my donor car yet so I am not sure exactly where the EGT probes go but I think keeping them in the factory position would be best if able.

Please call with any questions.
